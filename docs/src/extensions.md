# Extensions

We point out that the framework of this package about the non-smooth ODE is generic enough, so that one can easily extends it to compute kinds of non-smooth ODE's invariant manifolds.

To show how to extends the function [`generate_curves`](@ref) to other type of non-smooth ODE, we show how to deal with the systems with both impacts and piecewise smoothness.
